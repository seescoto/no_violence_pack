# no_violence_pack

A minecraft datapack that allows users to win (get to the end) and experience all the game has to offer on peaceful mode. The user doesn't have to kill any animals, fish for anything, or fight any mobs, but will still have the means to obtain all useful resources that exist in the game.

### NOT INCLUDED IN RECIPES:

-  heads (used only for decoration, obtained in non-peaceful mode by killing monsters, as some mob types have a rare chance of dropping a head when killed.)

-  other resources as overlooked
